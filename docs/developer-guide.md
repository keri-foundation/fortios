# Fort-ios developer guide

This guide contains the detailed setup and tooling reference for contributors.
For the short project overview and common entry points, see the repository README.

## Requirements

- macOS and Xcode 26.5 with the iOS 26.5 SDK and Simulator runtime. The app
  deployment target is iOS 16.4.
- mise and Node 22.12.0, as pinned in `.tool-versions`.
- Python 3.12 for the FortWeb runtime-source acquisition and build tools.
- SwiftLint for `make lint`.

The app runtime is separate from the host Python used by these tools. The
bundled FortWeb package contains Pyodide 314.0.5 and Python 3.14.2.

## Prepare the FortWeb runtime

`make payload-contract` packages and imports the FortWeb runtime. A clean
FortWeb checkout does not already contain the acquired runtime source or its
built `dist/runtime` directory. The following procedure reproduces the inputs
used by iOS Security Checks.

### Source pins and ownership

The values below are verified in the Fort-ios Makefile and
`.github/workflows/ios-security.yml`:

| Input | Value | Owner |
|-------|-------|-------|
| FortWeb producer checkout | `bdb81afa7593603141e8db306f0636a583d2db02` | CI workflow |
| Runtime source release | `runtime-source-pyodide-314-20260909` | CI workflow |
| Runtime source archive URL | `https://github.com/keri-foundation/fortweb/releases/download/runtime-source-pyodide-314-20260909/runtime-source.tar.gz` | CI workflow |
| Runtime source archive SHA-256 | `e04833249eec88596e0f2f88d32baa6d5fae6b2e964996587061ddac4bd78c72` | CI workflow |
| Runtime source manifest path | `build/runtime-source/manifest.json` | Makefile and CI workflow |
| Runtime source manifest SHA-256 | `87bcc689d7778840a76284471ff599cef21be41df2b429724f7f4fdc5f022135` | Makefile and CI workflow |

The Makefile defaults `FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_MANIFEST_SHA256` for local
packaging. It does not pin the FortWeb checkout commit or source archive hash.
CI separately pins the producer commit, archive URL and hash, and manifest
hash. Keep these roles distinct when updating producer inputs.

### Obtain and prepare the producer

Run these commands from the Fort-ios repository root. If `../fortweb` already
exists, verify its remote and checkout before using it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keri-foundation/fortweb.git ../fortweb
git -C ../fortweb checkout bdb81afa7593603141e8db306f0636a583d2db02
npm ci
npm ci --prefix ../fortweb
python3.12 -m venv ../fortweb/.venv
source ../fortweb/.venv/bin/activate
```

Keep the virtual environment active for the remaining commands. The producer
scripts use `python3`; with the environment active, package installation stays
inside the FortWeb checkout's ignored `.venv` instead of changing the global
Python installation or adding an environment to Fort-ios.

Set the inputs used by the producer build:

```sh
export FORTWEB_DIR=../fortweb
export FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_URL=https://github.com/keri-foundation/fortweb/releases/download/runtime-source-pyodide-314-20260909/runtime-source.tar.gz
export FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_ARCHIVE_SHA256=e04833249eec88596e0f2f88d32baa6d5fae6b2e964996587061ddac4bd78c72
export FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_MANIFEST=build/runtime-source/manifest.json
export FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_MANIFEST_SHA256=87bcc689d7778840a76284471ff599cef21be41df2b429724f7f4fdc5f022135
```

Acquire and verify the source archive and manifest, install the producer build
tools from the verified local wheelhouse, and build the runtime:

```sh
(cd "$FORTWEB_DIR" && python3 scripts/acquire_runtime_source.py \
  --url "$FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_URL" \
  --sha256 "$FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_ARCHIVE_SHA256" \
  --manifest-sha256 "$FORTWEB_RUNTIME_SOURCE_MANIFEST_SHA256" \
  --output build/runtime-source)

python3 -m pip install --disable-pip-version-check --no-index --no-deps \
  "$FORTWEB_DIR/build/runtime-source/wheelhouse/packaging-26.1-py3-none-any.whl" \
  "$FORTWEB_DIR/build/runtime-source/wheelhouse/setuptools-83.0.0-py3-none-any.whl" \
  "$FORTWEB_DIR/build/runtime-source/wheelhouse/wheel-0.47.0-py3-none-any.whl"

(cd "$FORTWEB_DIR" && npm run build:runtime)
```

Build and import the canonical package from the Fort-ios repository root:

```sh
make payload-contract FORTWEB_DIR="$FORTWEB_DIR"
```

This packages the FortWeb `dist/runtime` output, imports the ZIP into
`WebPayload/`, and checks the payload contract. Run it again after changing the
FortWeb runtime input. `WebPayload/` is generated output. Do not edit or stage
its contents directly.

## Payload import flow

FortWeb produces the runtime ZIP; Fort-ios imports and validates it; Xcode
bundles the resulting files into the app:

```text
FortWeb package:runtime
    -> fortweb-runtime-0.0.0.zip
    -> tools/import-fortweb-runtime-package.mjs
    -> WebPayload/ (manifest.json and runtime files)
    -> KeriWallet.app
```

The importer checks the manifest, file hashes, entry point, and path
containment before replacing `WebPayload/`. `make payload-contract` runs the
payload containment, integrity, Pyodide runtime, and mobile payload checks.

## Common Make targets

Run `make help` for the current complete target list.

| Target | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `make setup` | Install Fort-ios Node dependencies with `npm ci` |
| `make payload-package` | Build the FortWeb runtime ZIP |
| `make payload-import` | Import the runtime ZIP into `WebPayload/` |
| `make payload-contract` | Import and validate the staged payload |
| `make xcode-ready` | Resolve a simulator, prepare a missing payload, and check contracts |
| `make ios-doctor` | Check Xcode, simulator, and payload-source readiness |
| `make ios-resolve-sim` | Show the selected simulator |
| `make build` | Build KeriWallet for iOS Simulator |
| `make run-sim` | Boot, install, and launch on the resolved simulator |
| `make dev-device` | Build for a generic iOS device destination |
| `make run-device DEVICE_REF=<udid-or-name>` | Install and launch on a device |
| `make parity-smoke DEVICE_REF=<udid-or-name>` | Build, install, and launch smoke on simulator and device |
| `make lint` | Run strict SwiftLint checks |
| `make test-tools` | Run Node tooling tests |
| `make test-swift` | Run Swift unit and UI tests on Simulator |
| `make test-all` | Run Swift and Node tests |
| `make bridge-check` | Check generated bridge contract files |
| `make logs-sim` / `make logs-device` | Show recent app logs |
| `make clean` | Remove derived build, test result, and package output |

`parity-smoke` is build, install, and launch smoke support. It does not establish
wallet acceptance, vault setup or unlocking, persistence, or end-to-end KERI
acceptance.

## npm scripts

Use Make targets for routine work. These npm scripts are called by Make or are
available for focused diagnostics:

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run bridge:check` | Check generated Swift and Kotlin bridge files |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest tooling suite |
| `npm run runtime:import` | Import a canonical FortWeb runtime ZIP |
| `npm run check:payload` | Check staged payload containment and integrity |
| `npm run validate:runtime-platform-config` | Validate the iOS runtime platform configuration |
| `npm run test:runtime-platform-config` | Test the runtime platform configuration validator |
| `npm run validate:runtime-requirements-compatibility` | Validate FortWeb runtime requirements compatibility |
| `npm run test:runtime-requirements-compatibility` | Test the compatibility validator |
| `npm run verify:release-archive` | Check an archive contains the validated payload |

## Tests and diagnostics

### Swift tests

`make test-swift` runs Swift unit and UI tests using `xcodebuild test`. The test
targets use Swift Testing APIs such as `@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`, and
`#require`. The app target remains in Swift 5 language mode.

To choose a simulator explicitly, pass the destination to Xcode:

```sh
xcodebuild test \
  -project KeriWallet.xcodeproj \
  -scheme KeriWallet \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro'
```

### Node tooling tests

`make test-tools` runs the payload import, validation, and bridge tooling tests
with Vitest. Runtime platform and compatibility validators also have standalone
`node --test` suites. The tools run without a browser or WebAssembly runtime.

```sh
make test-tools
make test-all
```

For host-side diagnostics, use `make logs-sim`, `make logs-device`, or
Console.app to inspect payload loading, bridge messages, blocked navigation,
and scheme-handler errors.

## Bridge contract

`bridge-contract.json` is the committed source of truth. The generated Swift
and Kotlin declarations are `KeriWallet/BridgeContract.swift` and
`generated/BridgeContract.kt`. Run `make bridge-check` to verify that generated
files match the JSON contract. The generator is
`tools/gen-bridge-contract.mjs`.

The JavaScript-to-Swift message envelope includes a type and ISO 8601 timestamp:

```json
{
  "type": "lifecycle | js_error | log | crypto_result | unhandled_rejection",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "message": "<optional string>"
}
```

Do not hand-edit generated bridge declarations or `WebPayload/`. Use the
corresponding generator, importer, and contract checks.
